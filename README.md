Motion Analysis for Rehab Exercises

This project addresses the challenge of unsupervised rehabilitation exercises, where patients often perform movements incorrectly, leading to slower recovery, increased risk of injury, and reduced therapy effectiveness. Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, the system integrates video-based pose estimation with sensor-based activity recognition to deliver precise motion analysis and real-time feedback during physical therapy exercises.

Key Features:

Deep Learning-Based Motion Analysis: Utilizes state-of-the-art models trained on datasets like Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and PoseTrack to detect improper postures and assess exercise correctness.
Real-Time Feedback: Provides immediate guidance to patients, helping them execute exercises accurately and safely.
Comprehensive Tracking: Stores daily repetition counts, enabling users to monitor their progress over time.
Accessibility & Affordability: Designed as a lightweight solution suitable for remote or underserved areas, making quality rehabilitation support more widely available[1].
Integrated Data Sources: Combines video analysis with sensor data for robust and reliable motion tracking.
Project Objectives:

Ensure accurate execution of prescribed exercises
Reduce the risk of injury and improve rehabilitation efficiency
Offer an affordable and accessible tool for both patients and physiotherapists, especially where in-person supervision is limited.
This repository contains the codebase, data processing scripts, model training workflows, and documentation for deploying and evaluating the motion analysis system.
